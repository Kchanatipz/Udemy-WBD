        <p>From Samsopedia, the Samsonite encyclopedia</p>
        <p><b>Tumi Holdings, Inc.</b>, is a manufacturer of high-end suitcases and bags for
            travel based in Edison, New Jersey. Founded in 1975 by Charlie Clifford after a stint
            in the Peace Corps in Peru, the company is named after a Peruvian tumi ceremonial
            knife used for sacrifices. Tumi, Inc. was a unit of Doughty Hanson & Co. from 2004
            until after its 2012 initial public offering.</p>
        <p>Tumi's products are known for their black-on-black ballistic nylon. Tumi is available
            at department stores and specialty stores, as well as over 120 Tumi stores and
            200 shops around the world.</p>
        <p>Tumi puts a metal plate with a unique 20-digit registration number in each of its bags.
            Customers can register for the Tumi Tracer program to have their contact information
            entered into a central database so they can be reunited with their bag if it is found.</p>
