            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>1910 - 2001</h3>
            <p>The company was founded in Denver, Colorado, on March 10, 1910 by Black Hawk,
                Colorado-born luggage salesman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Shwayder">Jesse Shwayder</a>
                (1882-1970) as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company. A religious man, Shwayder
                named one of his initial cases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">Samson</a>
                , after the Biblical strongman, and began using the trademark Samsonite in 1941 for
                its tapered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanized_fibre">vulcanized fiber</a>
                suitcase, introduced in 1939.[9] In 1965, after the Samsonite suitcase became its
                best-selling product, the company changed its name to SAMSONITE. For many years the
                subsidiary SAMSONITE Furniture Co. made folding chairs and card tables in Murfreesboro
                , Tennessee.</p>
            <p>The Shwayder family sold the company to Beatrice Foods in 1973. In 1974,
                the company released the brand's first wheeled suitcase. Samsonite operated
                with relative independence within Beatrice until 1986, when the company was
                sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Subsequently, the company went through
                multiple changes of ownership in the 1980s and into the 1990s. First,
                Samsonite was spun off from KKR as part of E-II, which came under the control
                of American Brands. E-II went through bankruptcy and was renamed
                Astrum International. In 1993, Astrum purchased American Tourister luggage,
                complementing Samsonite.[10] In 1995, Astrum split, and an independent
                Samsonite (now including American Tourister) was once again headquartered
                in Denver.</p>
            <h3>2001 - 2010</h3>
            <p>The Denver factory, which employed 4,000 at its peak, closed in May 2001.
                Samsonite headquarters moved from Denver to Mansfield, Massachusetts,
                after a change of ownership in May 2005.</p>
            <p>Samsonite moved its US marketing and sales offices from 91 Main Street in Warren,
                Rhode Island, to Mansfield, Massachusetts, effective September 1, 2005</p>
            <p>In 2005, the company was acquired by Marcello Bottoli, former CEO of Louis Vuitton,
                to pull them out of a long slump.[11] Bottoli left the company in 2009.</p>
            <p>In July 2007, finance investor CVC Capital Partners took over Samsonite for $1.7 billion.
                CVC Capital Partners Ltd. became Samsonite's fifth owner in 21 years.</p>
            <p>On September 2, 2009, Samsonite Company Store LLC (U.S. Retail Division),formally
                known as Samsonite Company Stores Inc, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It planned to
                close up to 50% of its stores and discontinue the "Black Label" brand in
                the United States.</p>
            <h3>2010 - Present</h3>
            <p>June 2011, Samsonite raised US$1.25 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>In August 2012 Samsonite paid $35 million in cash to buy the high-end luggage brand
                Hartmann, which was founded in 1877.</p>
            <p>In June 2014, Samsonite agreed to buy technical outdoor backpack brand Gregory
                Mountain Products from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Diamond_Equipment">Black Diamond,
                    Inc.</a>
                , for US$85.0 million in cash</p>
            <p>In March 2016, Samsonite agreed to buy luxury baggage maker <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumi_Inc.">Tumi</a>
                for $1.8 billion in its largest ever acquisition.</p>
            <p>In April 2017, Samsonite agreed to acquire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBags.com">eBags</a>
                for $105 million in cash eBags generated $158.5 million in sales in 2016, up 23.5%
                from $128.3 million in 2015.</p>

        <h2>Entry into the toy market</h2>
        Beginning in 1961, Samsonite manufactured and distributed Lego building toys for
        the North American market under license from the Lego Group. A licensing dispute ended
        the arrangement in the U.S. in 1972, but Samsonite remained the distributor in Canada
        until 1986. Albert H. Reckler, then head of Military and export sales for the luggage division
        , brought the idea of manufacturing and selling Lego in the U.S. to Samsonite.
        He and Stan A. Clamage were instrumental in establishing the Lego brand in the United States.
        This was part of an overall company expansion into toy manufacturing in the 1960s that was
        abandoned in the 1970s.

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>Forty percent of all Samsonite hard luggage is manufactured at its plant in Nashik, India.
            Samsonite has two assembly plants in Hungary.</p>
        <p>Samsonite currently has a Better Business Organization rating of 'F',
            primarily because of Customer Service.</p>
        <p>In 2022, Samsonite decided to move production to Japan.</p>
        <p>Other production plants include Nashik, where Samsonite plans on expanding their
            manufacturing as the demand for travel has increased. Samsonite India plans to invest
            ₹110-115 crore to enhance its hard luggage manufacturing capacity from 5 lakh pieces
            a month to 7.5 lakh pieces by end of next year. The Expansion will include
            a 180,000 square foot of land for the plant to expand on.</p>
