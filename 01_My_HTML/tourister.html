        <p>From Samsopedia, the Samsonite encyclopedia</p>
        <p><b>American Tourister</b> is a brand of luggage owned by Samsonite. Brothers Sol and
            Irving Koffler founded <b>American Luggage Works</b> in Providence, Rhode Island,
            United States in 1933.[1][2] In 1993, American Tourister was acquired by
            Astrum International, which also owns Samsonite. Astrum was renamed as the
            Samsonite Corporation two years later. Their products include backpacks,
            suitcases and wallets. Today, the American Tourister brand is sold as a more
            affordable brand in the Samsonite portfolio.</p>
